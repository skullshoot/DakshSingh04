          <p id="intro">
            One day, the RR virus of unknown origin appears on earth, and disaster strikes the world. 
            The infected animals mutate into terrifying monsters and attack on a large-scale. 
            When humans faced destruction, they built walls and founded cities as humanity’s 
            last strongholds. The trials that mankind experiences during this period are called the 
            “Nirvana Period”. In such an extreme living environment, human physical strength also 
            gradually evolved and developed; martial arts sprang up, and human physical strength was 
            qualitatively increasing compared to before. And the best of them is called “Warriors”. 
            18-year-old Luo Feng also dreams of becoming one of them. Right now, he was about to take 
            the college entrance exam and face a choice at a crossroads in his life, but suddenly a 
            monster attack affects the trajectory of his life. The first challenge he had to confront 
            was the subtle, invisible influence of the external environment, which was shaped by 
            Luo Feng's family's poor condition and difficult life. His parents were unable to provide 
            much assistance, leaving him to rely solely on his own efforts. In the end, under constant 
            hard work, Luo Feng continued to explore his own potential and was recognized for his 
            increased abilities and self-esteem. Not only that, Luo Feng not only shouldered the burden 
            of supporting the family but also joined forces with other warriors of justice to face evil 
            monsters and protect the land of mankind for the survival and development of a better mankind. 
            In the desperate situation of doomsday, can Luo Feng and the other warriors repel the monsters 
            and successfully protect the human world?</p>
