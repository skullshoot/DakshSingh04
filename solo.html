          <p id="intro">In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess 
            supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from 
            certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a 
            seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an 
            overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, 
            a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, 
            gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength and turn anyone 
            he kills into a loyal minion called a shadow. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey 
            as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the 
            secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.</p>

                The main protagonist of series. Originally an infamous weak E-Rank hunter, 
                he gets the chance of a lifetime when he is selected as the Player of a magical 
                program called the System and gains the unique ability to grow in strength without limit. 
                By taking advantage of this new power offered to him by the System, 
                Jinwoo eventually rises up to become humanity's greatest hunter, 
                but also eventually finds himself to be a major player in a war that has been going on 
                forever between the Rulers and the Monarchs, two groups of unbelievably powerful humanoids 
                who have their own agendas with mankind.

                <p id="intro">
                    Korean S-Rank Hunter who specializes in swordsmanship and the only female S-Rank 
                    in the country. She has a rare condition that causes other hunters to smell foul 
                    to her and eventually develops romantic feelings for Jinwoo after witnessing him 
                    in action and discovering that he is the only hunter she has ever met who actually 
                    smells nice to her.
                </p>
                <h4>Yoo Jin-ho</h4>
                <br/>
                <p id="intro">
                    Korean D-Rank Hunter and Jinwoo's best friend. He comes from a very wealthy family 
                    and eventually becomes the vice chairman of Jinwoo's guild after he impresses the 
                    latter with his sense of loyalty and commitment. Jinho also shares a brother-like 
                    relationship with Jinwoo, due to the fact that he is estranged from his real 
                    biological brother, and tends to dress up in very fancy and expensive armor that 
                    he usually buys from foreign manufacturers, which serves as a prominent running 
                    gag throughout the series.

                    Jinwoo's younger sister. Unlike her brother, she is not a hunter and is a student 
                    in high school.
                </p>
                <h4>Sung Il-hwan</h4>

                    Korean S-Rank Hunter, Kyung-Hye's husband, and Jinwoo and Jinah's father. 
                    Ten years before the events of the main storyline, he suddenly disappeared 
                    inside a dungeon while on a raid, leaving his family to presume him dead.
                     However, about a decade later, he returned to the human world to aid his 
                     son in the coming war against the Monarchs and was eventually revealed to 
                     be a Rulers' vessel, one of the seven humans chosen by the Rulers to serve 
                     them as their hosts. Although Il-Hwan ultimately succeeded in his mission, 
                     he ended up exerting far more power than his body could handle in his last 
                     battle with the Monarchs and consequently died afterwards in his son's arms, 
                     with Jinwoo unable to do anything to save him.

                    and guilds active within Korea. Although he was later revealed to be a Rulers' vessel, 
                    he suffered from a variety of health problems due to his old age, 
                    preventing him from using his powers to their maximum output, 
                    and was ultimately killed by the Monarchs in battle.

                    ranking 1st in the world. He is also a Rulers' vessel and is nicknamed the Goliath 
                    due to his large build and immense superhuman strength. He later befriends Jinwoo 
                    after the latter defeats him in a fight and give him Kamish's Wrath,

                    and the final antagonist of Solo Leveling. After Jinwoo killed three of the other Monarchs,
                     Antares invaded the human world in order to draw him out and finish him off. 
                     However, despite his best efforts, he ultimately failed to achieve his ambitions 
                     and was killed by the Rulers.

                    making them the primary antagonists of the series. As a result, 
                    they have a cruel disregard for life and are generally very arrogant towards those 
                    they find inferior to themselves, especially humans. The Monarchs also each govern a 
                    different race of monsters and take after the race that they rule over in appearance.
                </p>
                <h4>Rulers</h4>
                <br/>

                    who aim to protect the human race from being annihilated by the Monarchs. 
                    Although they have noble ambitions, they are willing to use morally questionable 
                    methods to achieve them and are indirectly responsible for the millions of human 
                    lives lost ever since monsters first began using gates to cross over to the human world. 
                    The Rulers also heavily resemble angels in appearance and are able to use a form of 
                    telekinesis unique to themselves called Ruler's Authority.
