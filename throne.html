          <p id="intro">In a world where humans and demons coexist, a young boy named Long Hao Chen embarks on a journey to become a powerful knight and save his mother from a deadly illness. Six thousand years ago, the Demon God Emperor Feng Xiu and the seventy-two Demon God Pillars descended from the sky, plunging humanity into a dark age. To protect the remnants of humanity, six temples arose to oppose the demons' advance.

            Long Hao Chen, a nine-year-old boy with extraordinary spiritual energy, joins the Knight Temple, determined to become a knight and save his mother. Through his dedication and the support of his companions, he passes the knight exam and undergoes the Holy Resurrection Ritual, revealing his true potential as a Son of Light.
            
            As Long Hao Chen grows in strength and experience, he forms the "No. 1 Demon Hunting Group" with other talented youths from the six temples. Together, they face countless challenges, fighting for human survival and dignity. Along the way, Long Hao Chen uncovers deeper secrets and conspiracies that threaten to engulf the world.
            
            With his unwavering spirit and unwavering determination, Long Hao Chen strives to become the strongest knight, inherit the Divine Throne, and confront the ultimate crisis that looms over humanity.
