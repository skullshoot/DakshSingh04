          <p id="intro">Ever since the release of the innovative NerveGear, gamers from all around 
            the globe have been given the opportunity to experience a completely immersive virtual reality. 
            Sword Art Online (SAO), one of the most recent games on the console, offers a gateway 
            into the wondrous world of Aincrad, a vivid, medieval landscape where users can do 
            anything within the limits of imagination. With the release of this worldwide sensation, 
            gaming has never felt more lifelike.

            However, the idyllic fantasy rapidly becomes a brutal nightmare when SAO's creator traps 
            thousands of players inside the game. The "log-out" function has been removed, with the 
            only method of escape involving beating all of Aincrad's one hundred increasingly 
            difficult levels. Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, 
            ending the player's life in the real world.
            
            While Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, 
            he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. 
            Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to 
            face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on. But with difficult bosses and 
            threatening dark cults impeding his progress, Kirito finds that such tasks are much 
            easier said than done.</p>
